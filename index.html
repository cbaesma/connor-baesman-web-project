	<h1>In-Development Item Building Site</h1><br>
	So this site doesn't really have much yet. Mostly non-functional stuff just to help get the layout together. Look around if you want, but there's not much to see.<br>
	You can look at the specific pages down below.<br><br>

		This isn't a site that would really warrant any commerce, so I wrenched together a vague donation site with some online tools.<br>
		Click on any of this text to go there anyway.</h2></a>
