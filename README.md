# connor-baesman-web-project
Access to the web project I've been working on for my web development intro class.

The site currently doesn't have any real functions beyond traversing the various pages, and a basic input field with a placeholder backend script.

There are no comments as of writing this either. I am aware of this, and have made notes to include some. Eventually.
In truth, it's extremely crude and rudametary, and far from the proudest thing I've worked on.

It's still unfinished and unpolished in a lot of places, and that I'm not nearly so sure when I'll work on...
Alas. Here we are.
